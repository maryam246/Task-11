# Python collections.
The collection Module in Python provides different types of containers. A Container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. Some of the built-in containers are Tuple, List, Dictionary, etc. 
# Counters.
A counter is a sub-class of the dictionary. It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.
# OrderedDict.
An OrderedDict is also a sub-class of dictionary but unlike dictionary, it remembers the order in which the keys were inserted. 
# Defaultdict.
A DefaultDict is also a sub-class to dictionary. It is used to provide some default values for the key that does not exist and never raises a KeyError.
# Chain map.
A ChainMap encapsulates many dictionaries into a single unit and returns a list of dictionaries.
# NamedTuple.
A NamedTuple returns a tuple object with names for each position which the ordinary tuples lack. 
# Deque.
Deque (Doubly Ended Queue) is the optimized list for quicker append and pop operations from both sides of the container.
# Heap.
A heap in Python is a data structure based on a unique binary tree designed to efficiently access the smallest or largest element in a collection of items.
# Collections.Userdict.
Userdict is a dictionary-like container that acts as a wrapper around the dictionary objects. This container is used when someone wants to create their own dictionary with some modified or new functionality. 
# Collections.UserList.
UserList is a list like container that acts as a wrapper around the list objects. This is useful when someone wants to create their own list with some modified or additional functionality.
# Collections.UserString.
UserString is a string like container and just like UserDict and UserList it acts as a wrapper around string objects. It is used when someone wants to create their own strings with some modified or additional functionality.
